* feat: keep some or all stale history items and display them

* fix: dream send and recv in the same place to avoid crashing

See https://github.com/camlworks/dream/issues/230

- [ ] workaround the crash by doing recv and send in the same place so
  that we can always do recv before send, minimizing the crash window.

* fix: indexdb needs to store multiple tables

- [X] table id stored and queried with items so we can use one object
  store, since object store can only be created on version changes.
- [X] create an index on table name
- [X] save items with table name
- [X] load items with keyrange query for table name
- [X] use the hulc for the item key
- [X] support deleting items

* feat: edit the title and user

- [X] sign-in sets the user cookie and directs to index
- [ ] index lists tables and allows creating a new one
- [X] title is an editable field which does not change the URL
- [X] read the user from a cookie controlled by the server

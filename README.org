* Design

** Service Worker

The service worker can store data locally and take care of resending
failures. It allows the application to run offline.

1. [ ] Connect with an open websocket
2. [ ] Client request/response
3. [ ] Push to client
4. [ ] Local storage idempotently
5. [ ] Resend everything for anti-entropy

*** sw_of_ocaml

I copied in some code from this [[https://github.com/derui/sw_of_ocaml][sw_of_ocaml]] repo, some of which is
outdated in its types (?).
